**the Reverse SaaS Company**

> **Reinventing Software. Empowering Developers. Owning the Future.**

Hi there 👋 — welcome to **Valkyr Labs**, the creators of the **Valhalla Suite** — a unified ecosystem for **agentic code generation**, **AI-driven workflow orchestration**, and **secure app hosting**.

Our mission is simple but radical:  
**Give developers and founders total control over their code, data, and AI.**

## 🧠 What We Build

| Product | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **🧩 [ThorAPI](https://github.com/ValkyrLabs/thorapi)** | An **OpenAPI-driven code generator** that builds secure Java Spring Boot backends with TypeScript/React frontends automatically. |
| **🧠 [ValkyrAI](https://valkyrlabs.com/v1/Products/ValkyrAI/valkyrai-overview)** | An **agentic workflow engine** that turns OpenAPI specs into live, orchestrated automations. Think Zapier meets Kubernetes. |
| **💻 [ValorIDE](https://github.com/ValkyrLabs/valoride)** | A **next-generation AI coding environment** with agentic “Vibe Coding” support and seamless integration with MCP servers and Valhalla components. |
| **🧮 [GridHeim](https://valkyrlabs.com/v1/Products/ValkyrAI/gridheim-overview)** | A **spreadsheet-based computation engine** for formulas, models, and live data feeds — the backbone for ValkyrAI data workflows. |
| **🔐 [SecureField](https://valkyrlabs.com/v1/Products/SecureField/SecureField-getting-started) / SecureKMS** | **Zero-trust field-level encryption** and key management for every generated service. |

Together, these form the **Valhalla Stack** — the foundation of our “**Reverse SaaS**” movement.

## 🌀 The Reverse SaaS Revolution

Traditional SaaS locks you into *their* platform.  
**Reverse SaaS (RSaaS)** flips that model — we give you **your own** hosted, generated stack.

- 🧬 **Spec → Service → App** in minutes  
- 🔒 **Own your code, database, and keys**  
- ⚙️ **Deploy anywhere** (Docker, Fargate, Bare Metal)  
- 🧩 **Integrate everything** (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, MCP)
